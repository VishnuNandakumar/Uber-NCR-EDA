# Uber NCR Ride Bookings - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview
This project performs an **end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Uber ride bookings in the **National Capital Region (NCR)**.  
The goal is to uncover **ride patterns, customer behavior, demand trends, and service quality insights** to provide **data-driven recommendations** for improving efficiency, customer satisfaction, and revenue optimization.

## Objectives
- Analyze **ride demand patterns** by time, day, and location.  
- Study **fare distribution and distance trends**.  
- Explore **payment preferences** of customers.  
- Identify **peak vs off-peak demand**.  
- Understand **cancellation trends** (customer vs driver).  
- Evaluate **service ratings** for drivers and customers.  
- Provide **business recommendations** for optimization.

## Key Observations
1. Ride demand peaks during **8‚Äì10 AM & 6‚Äì9 PM** (commute hours).  
2. Weekends show slightly **higher bookings** than weekdays.  
3. Most rides are **short-to-mid distance (<25 km)**.  
4. **Digital payments dominate** over cash.  
5. **Customer cancellations > Driver cancellations**.  
6. Both **Driver & Customer Ratings** cluster around 4‚Äì5 stars.  
7. **Affordable vehicles (Sedan/Auto)** dominate bookings.  
8. **Off-peak hours** see low demand and driver underutilization.
